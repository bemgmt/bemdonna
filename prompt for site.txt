I have created the following plan after thorough exploration and analysis of the codebase. Follow the below plan verbatim. Trust the files and references. Do not re-verify what's written in the plan. Explore only when absolutely necessary. First implement all the proposed file changes and then I'll review all the changes together at the end.

### Observations

The current codebase is a single-page prelaunch landing page built with Next.js 16, React 19, and TailwindCSS 4. It features a modern SaaS design with glass morphism, gradient accents (cyan/purple), and includes basic sections: Hero, Features, Pricing, FAQ, and a waitlist form. The instructions require transforming this into a comprehensive production SaaS website with 40+ pages across 7 main sections, CMS integration, SEO optimization, blog infrastructure, industry-specific pages, product pages, resources section, and interactive demos. The project follows a 5-phase build approach from MVP to full interactive demos.

### Approach

Transform the single-page landing into a multi-page Next.js application using the App Router with proper routing structure. Integrate a headless CMS (Sanity recommended for its real-time collaboration and Next.js integration). Create a comprehensive component library extending existing components. Implement SEO infrastructure with metadata API, schema markup, and sitemap generation. Build reusable page templates for blog, case studies, and documentation. Establish a design system with shared layouts and consistent styling. Structure the project in 5 phases: MVP (core pages), Product Expansion (product/industry pages), Resources/SEO Engine (blog/docs), Enterprise features (investor/careers), and Interactive Demos.

### Reasoning

I explored the repository structure to understand the current implementation, read the comprehensive instructions file detailing all requirements, examined existing components to understand the design system and patterns, reviewed the package.json to identify available libraries, and analyzed the styling approach to ensure consistency across new pages.
